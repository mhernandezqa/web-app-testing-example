# E-Shop Web App Testing Example

# A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in Python showing how to perform UI tests on web applications with the Selenium library and the Pytest test framwework.

This project uses as reference a web application built for testing pruposes: https://www.saucedemo.com/. This project shows how to do the following:

* Establish a base directory structure for organizing your test files, reusable test data, utilities and web pages locators.

* Create the starting pages file, such as base_page.py, which contains the skeleton of the web page on top of which you should keep building more specific section structures.

* Create the starting test file, such as test_base.py, which contains the essential actions that must be executed before each separated test: initialize the webdriver and login.

* Create the conftest.py file, which contains the essential pytest fixtures to perform the tests succesfully.
